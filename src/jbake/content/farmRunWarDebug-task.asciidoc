farmRunWar starts farm web-apps as WAR-files, in interactive and debug mode.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmRunWarDebug
----

== Effects
. By default each farm web-app is compiled and assembled into WAR-file (if it's not up-to-date).
. If farm configuration link:Multiple-web-apps-tutorial.html#Mixing-inplace-and-WAR-mode[overrides inplace property] for some web-apps to `true`, then each of these web-apps gets compiled without creating WAR-file (if itâ€™s not up-to-date).
. Embedded jetty starts in separate java process against WAR-files (and, optionally, against compiled classes and their dependencies). +
*important*: Upon start, the process is in suspended-mode and listens for debugger commands on port 5005.
. Upon resume, jetty process starts listening for HTTP-requests on link:Farm-configuration.html#port[port] (default 8080).
. Gretty waits for the user keypress.
. When user presses any key (in the same terminal), jetty process shuts down.
. Gretty waits for jetty process to complete.
. Gradle script continues normal execution of tasks.

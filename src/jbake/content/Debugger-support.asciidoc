All appRunXXX and appStartXXX tasks have their debugging counterparts. For example, there are tasks appRun and appRunDebug. appRun starts web-app "normally", while appRunDebug starts web-app in suspended mode and listens for debugger commands on port 5005.

Author of Gretty plugin tested debugging only under Netbeans IDE. It should also work under other IDEs, but it's not tested yet.

Author of Gretty plugin invites all interested parties to testing Gretty debugging features under other IDEs.

All jettyRunXXX and jettyStartXXX tasks have their debugging
counterparts. For example, there are tasks jettyRun and jettyRunDebug.
jettyRun starts web-app "normally", while jettyRunDebug starts
web-app in suspended mode and listens for debugger commands on
port 5005.

Author of Gretty plugin tested debugging only under Netbeans IDE. It
should also work under other IDEs, but it's not tested yet.

Author of Gretty plugin invites all interested parties to testing Gretty
debugging features under other IDEs.

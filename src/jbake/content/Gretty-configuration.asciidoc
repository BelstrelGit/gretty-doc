When you apply gretty plugin, it adds +gretty+ extension to the
project. You can (but you don't have to) customize every aspect of gretty plugin
with the help of gretty DSL:

[source,groovy]
----
gretty {
  port = 8081
  contextPath = '/MyWebApp'
  // ... many more properties
}
----

All gretty tasks, when invoked on given project, use properties of gretty extension.

If you don't specify any properties in gretty extension (or omit it altogether),
gretty tasks run with reasonable defaults.

== Server-specific properties

Gretty extension supports the following server-specific properties:

[cols="1,1,1,10", options="header"]
|===
| Property
| Type
| Default
| Purpose

| [[_jvmargs]] jvmArgs
| List<String>
| []
| Additional JVM arguments to servlet-container process.

| [[_host]] host
| String
| "localhost"
| host is passed to servlet-container connectors. If you use HTTPS, host must match CN of the subject DN of the certificate (if you use link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_auto_configuration[HTTP auto-configuration], Gretty ensures this automatically).

| [[_httpenabled]] httpEnabled
| boolean
| true
| When httpEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTP connector for the designated httpPort. Otherwise HTTP protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true.

| [[_httpport]] httpPort
| int
| 8080
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTP-requests.

| [[_port]] port
| int
| 8080
| This property is exactly the same as httpPort

| [[_httpidletimeout]] httpIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTP connection can be idle before it is closed.

| [[_httpsenabled]] httpsEnabled
| boolean
| false
| When httpsEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTPS connector for the designated httpsPort. Otherwise HTTPS protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html[HTTPS support].

| [[_httpsport]] httpsPort
| int
| 8443
| TCP-port used by servlet-container for incoming HTTPS-requests. +
**Attention:** setting httpsPort alone is not enough to enable HTTPS protocol. You must set httpsEnabled=true in order to enable HTTPS.

| [[_sslkeystorepath]] sslKeyStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| null
| Absolute or relative path to the key-store, containing key and certificate for HTTPS connection. If sslKeyStorePath is not specified, all other SSL-related properties are ignored and HTTPS is auto-configured (if it is enabled). +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_sslkeystorepassword]] sslKeyStorePassword
| String
| null
| Password for the key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_sslkeymanagerpassword]] sslKeyManagerPassword
| String
| sslKeyStorePassword
| Password for the key of this host, stored in key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_ssltruststorepath]] sslTrustStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| sslKeyStorePath
| Absolute or relative path to the trust-store for HTTPS connection.  +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_sslkeystorepassword]] sslKeyStorePassword
| String
| null
| Password for the key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#_https_manual_configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[_httpsidletimeout]] httpsIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTPS connection can be idle before it is closed.

| [[_serviceport]] servicePort
| int
| 9900
| TCP-port used by Gretty to send commands to servlet-container process.

| [[_statusport]] statusPort
| int
| 9901
| TCP-port used by servlet-container process to send status back to Gretty.

| [[_jettyxmlfile]] jettyXmlFile
| String or java.io.File
| "jetty.xml"
| Name and/or location of "jetty.xml" file. +
See also: link:jetty.xml-support.html[jetty.xml support].

| [[_scaninterval]] scanInterval
| int
| 0
| Hot-deployment scan interval, in seconds. +
See also: link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment].

| [[_logbackconfigfile]] logbackConfigFile
| String
| "logback.groovy" or "logback.xml"

| [[_onstart]] onStart
| function(Closure)

| function(Closure)
| -
| Adds closure to be called just after servlet-container is stopped.

| [[_onscan]] onScan

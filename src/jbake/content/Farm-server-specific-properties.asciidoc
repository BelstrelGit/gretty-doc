Farm configuration defines it's own set of server-specific properties. When you run a farm task, it uses server-specific properties defined in farm configuration and ignores server-specific properties defined in gretty configurations. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
gretty {
  port = 8181
}

farm {
  port = 9191
  webapp project
}
----

* when you invoke `gradle farmRun`, it serves port 9191, not 8181.
* when you invoke `gradle jettyRun`, it serves port 8181, because jettyXXX tasks don't use farms.

|===
| Property
| Type
| Default
| Purpose

| [[jvmArgs]] jvmArgs
| List<String>
| []
| Additional JVM arguments to Jetty process.

| [[host]] host
| String
| "localhost"
| host is passed to Jetty connectors. If you use HTTPS, host must match CN of the subject DN of the certificate (if you use link:HTTPS-support.html#HTTPS-Auto-configuration[HTTP auto-configuration], this is ensured automatically).

| [[httpEnabled]] httpEnabled
| boolean
| true
| When httpEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTP connector for the designated httpPort. Otherwise HTTP protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true.

| [[httpPort]] httpPort
| int
| 8080
| TCP-port used by Jetty for incoming HTTP-requests.

| [[port]] port
| int
| 8080
| This property is exactly the same as httpPort

| [[httpIdleTimeout]] httpIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTP connection can be idle before it is closed. +
See also: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-connectors.html[Jetty documentation, configuring connectors].

| [[httpsEnabled]] httpsEnabled
| boolean
| false
| When httpsEnabled is true, Gretty configures HTTPS connector for the designated httpsPort. Otherwise HTTPS protocol is disabled. Normally either httpEnabled or httpsEnabled should be true. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html[HTTPS support].

| [[httpsPort]] httpsPort
| int
| 8443
| TCP-port used by Jetty for incoming HTTPS-requests. +
**Attention:** setting httpsPort alone is not enough to enable HTTPS protocol. You must set httpsEnabled=true in order to enable HTTPS.

| [[sslKeyStorePath]] sslKeyStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| null
| Absolute or relative path to the key-store, containing key and certificate for HTTPS connection. If sslKeyStorePath is not specified, all other SSL-related properties are ignored and HTTPS is auto-configured (if it is enabled). +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#https-manual-configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[sslKeyStorePassword]] sslKeyStorePassword
| String
| null
| Password for the key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#https-manual-configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[sslKeyManagerPassword]] sslKeyManagerPassword
| String
| sslKeyStorePassword
| Password for the key of this host, stored in key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#https-manual-configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[sslTrustStorePath]] sslTrustStorePath
| String or java.io.File
| sslKeyStorePath
| Absolute or relative path to the trust-store for HTTPS connection.  +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#https-manual-configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[sslKeyStorePassword]] sslKeyStorePassword
| String
| null
| Password for the key-store designated by property sslKeyStorePath. +
See also: link:HTTPS-support.html#https-manual-configuration[HTTPS manual configuration]

| [[httpsIdleTimeout]] httpsIdleTimeout
| int
| null
| When not null, defines the time, in milliseconds, that the HTTPS connection can be idle before it is closed. +
See also: http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-connectors.html[Jetty documentation, configuring connectors].

| [[servicePort]] servicePort
| int
| 9900
| TCP-port used by Gretty to send commands to Jetty process.

| [[statusPort]] statusPort
| int
| 9901
| TCP-port used by Jetty process to send status back to Gretty.

| [[jettyXmlFile]] jettyXmlFile
| String or java.io.File
| "jetty.xml"
| Name and/or location of "jetty.xml" file. +
See also: link:jetty.xml-support.html[jetty.xml support].

| [[scanInterval]] scanInterval
| int
| 0
| Hot-deployment scan interval, in seconds. +
See also: link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment].

| [[logbackConfigFile]] logbackConfigFile
| String
| "logback.groovy" or "logback.xml"
| Absolute or relative path to logback configuration file (.groovy or .xml). +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[loggingLevel]] loggingLevel
| String
| "INFO"
| slf4j logging-level for jetty process. +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[consoleLogEnabled]] consoleLogEnabled
| boolean
| true
| Defines whether log messages are written to the terminal. +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[fileLogEnabled]] fileLogEnabled
| boolean
| true
| Defines, whether log messages are written to the log-file. +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[logFileName]] logFileName
| String
| "${project.name}.log"
| Log file name (without path). +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[logDir]] logDir
| String
| "${user.home}/logs"
| Directory, where the log file is created. +
See also: link:Logging.html[Logging].

| [[onStart]] onStart
| function(Closure)
| -
| Adds closure to be called just before jetty server is started.

| [[onStop]] onStop
| function(Closure)
| -
| Adds closure to be called just after jetty server is stopped.

| [[onScan]] onScan
| function(Closure)
| -
| Adds closure to be called on hot-deployment scan. +
See also: link:Hot-deployment.html[Hot deployment].

| [[onScanFilesChanged]] onScanFilesChanged
| function(Closure)

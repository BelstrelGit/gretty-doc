= farmStop task

farmStop sends "stop" command to a running jetty server.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmStop
----

== Effects

farmStop does not build source code, it only sends "stop" command to
localhost:link:Farm-configuration#servicePort[servicePort]. Usually
farmStop is used to stop Gretty/Jetty process started by farmStart[War][Debug].

WARNING: do not try to stop Jetty server with farmStop, if it was started with jettyStart[War][Debug] or with farmStart[War][Debug] from another farm. Reason is simple: each farm may redefine it's TCP-ports in farm configuration, so farmStop may be sending a command on incorrect port, when paired with wrong start task.

farmStop sends "stop" command to a running servlet-container process.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmStop
----

== Effects

farmStop does not build source code, it only sends "stop" command to localhost:link:Farm-configuration.html#_serviceport[servicePort]. Usually farmStop is used to stop servlet-container process started by farmStart[War][Debug].

WARNING: do not try to stop servlet-container process with farmStop, if it was started with appStart[War][Debug] or with farmStart[War][Debug] from another farm. Reason is simple: each farm may define it's own set of TCP-ports in farm configuration, so farmStop may be sending a command to incorrect port, when paired with wrong start task.

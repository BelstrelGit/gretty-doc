This part of documentation is coming soon!

For now:

The feature is fully implemented. Try it yourself on the example project:

https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty/tree/master/examples/farm9/MyWebApp

there invoke `gradle farmIntegrationTest` - you'll see integration tests running for multiple web-apps on the same Jetty server.

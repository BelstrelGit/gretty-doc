Since version 1.1.4 Gretty supports passing special arguments to Gretty products, which are "tunneled" to Gretty runner (web-server). For example, when you add the following code to product's run.sh script:

[source,bash]
---
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF8 -cp "${DIR}/conf/:${DIR}/starter/*" org.akhikhl.gretty.GrettyStarter --runnerArg=-Xms1024m --runnerArg=-Xmx2048m $@ run
---

then Gretty runner will be launched with additional arguments "-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m".

Here are all Gretty-runner-specific arguments:

[cols="1,1,6", options="header"]
|===
| Form
| Purpose

| --runnerArg=value
| value will be passed as an argument to Gretty runner's JVM

| --runnerArgFile=file
| file is expected to be an existing file, containing space-separated on line-separated list of arguments to Gretty runner's JVM


| --runnerArgURL=url
| url is expected to be a valid URL, pointing to an existing location of arguments file. The file is expected to have the same format as for runnerArgFile

| --runnerOverrideArgs=true/false
| when true, the arguments specified in jvmArgs property in server.json are ignored.

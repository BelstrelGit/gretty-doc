= farm extension

When you apply gretty-farm plugin, it adds *farm* extension object to the current project.

You can (but you don't have to) configure farm extension object in your gradle script:

[source,groovy]
----
farm {
  // ... properties
}
----

Farm extension object corresponds to default farm.

Default farm defines set of link:Farm-tasks[farm tasks]: farmRun, farmRunDebug, etc.

If you don't specify any farm properties (or omit farm extension object altogether),
farm tasks run with reasonable defaults.

Farm consists of two parts:

* link:Farm-server-specific-properties[Farm server-specific properties]
* link:Farm-web-app-list[Farm web-app list]

See also: link:index#Multiple-web-apps[Multiple web-apps].

Gretty automatically invokes this task before integration test task, referred in
link:Gretty-configuration.html#_integrationtesttask[integrationTestTask] property of gretty configuration.

WARNING: Internal task, please, don't invoke it on command line!

== Effects

. Embedded jetty starts in separate java process against compiled
classes and their dependencies and listens for HTTP-requests on
link:Gretty-configuration.html#_port[port] (default 8080).
. Gradle script waits until jetty is online.
. Gradle script proceeds to integration test task.

== Instantiation and extension

The object called jettyBeforeIntegrationTest is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes.html#_jettybeforeintegrationtesttask[JettyBeforeIntegrationTestTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.JettyBeforeIntegrationTestTask

task('MyBeforeIntegration', type: JettyBeforeIntegrationTestTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialBeforeIntegration extends JettyBeforeIntegrationTestTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyBeforeIntegration2', type: VerySpecialBeforeIntegration) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.

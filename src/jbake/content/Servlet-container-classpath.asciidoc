= Servlet container classpath

Gretty supports the ability to add dependencies to the servlet container classpath
(as opposed to the classpath of web-app).

This can be used to add libraries, such as JDBC drivers, which may be
needed when Jetty is starting up. You can add your dependencies using
the `gretty` configuration:

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
  // ...
  gretty 'org.hsqldb:hsqldb:+'
  // ...
}
----

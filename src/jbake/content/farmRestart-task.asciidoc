farmRestart sends "restart" command to a running jetty server.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle farmRestart
----

== Effects

farmRestart does not build source code, it only sends "restart" command to
localhost:link:Farm-configuration.html#_serviceport[servicePort]. Usually
farmRestart is used to restart Gretty/Jetty process started by farmStart[War][Debug].

WARNING: do not try to restart Jetty server with farmRestart, if it was started with jettyStart[War][Debug] or with farmStart[War][Debug] from another farm. Reason is simple: each farm may redefine it's TCP-ports in farm configuration, so farmRestart may be sending a command on incorrect port, when paired with wrong start task.

= jettyRestart task

jettyRestart sends "restart" command to a running jetty server.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle jettyRestart
----

== Effects

jettyRestart does not build source code, it only sends "restart" command to
localhost:link:Gretty-configuration#servicePort[servicePort]. Usually
jettyRestart is used to restart Gretty/Jetty process started by jettyStart[War][Debug].

== Instantiation and extension

The object called jettyRestart is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes#jettyrestarttask[JettyRestartTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.JettyRestartTask

task('MyRestart', type: JettyRestartTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialRestart extends JettyRestartTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyRestart2', type: VerySpecialRestart) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.

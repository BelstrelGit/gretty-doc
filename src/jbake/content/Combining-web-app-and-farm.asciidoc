= Combining web-app and farm

Gretty-farm plugin does not have to be applied to the root project. You can apply it to arbitrary gradle project in the same project tree, for example to some web-app:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'gretty'
apply plugin: 'gretty-farm'
----

Each of these plugins adds it's own stuff to the project:

* gretty plugin adds link:Gretty-configuration[gretty configuration] and set of link:Gretty-tasks[gretty tasks]: jettyRun, jettyRunDebug, ... 
* gretty-farm plugin adds link:Farm-configuration[farm configuration] and set of link:Farm-tasks[farm tasks]: farmRun, farmRunDebug, ... 

Everything added by gretty plugin relates to single web-app only. +
Everything added by gretty-farm plugin relates to multiple web-apps.

Gretty supports debugging a farm with a set of special gradle tasks: farmRunDebug, farmRunWarDebug, farmStartDebug, farmStartWarDebug.

When you invoke one of the debugging tasks, a farm starts jetty server with all farm web-apps, in suspended mode, and waits for debugger commands on port 5005.

NOTE: Author of Gretty plugin tested farm debugging under Netbeans IDE. In principle, it should work under other Java IDEs as well, but it's not tested yet.

IMPORTANT: The project, containing a farm, must be a JVM project (Java, Groovy, etc.), otherwise IDE does not send debugging commands to the debugged JVM process over port 5005. This requirement is easily fulfilled, when you apply gretty-farm plugin to one of the web-apps, as link:Combining-web-app-and-farm.html[described before].

In real life you are likely to face two problems:

- web-apps are not subprojects of farm project 
- you do not want all web-apps to be started, only subset of them

For such cases you'll need to define farm configuration. Edit the file "ProjectA/build.gradle", insert code:

[source,groovy]
----
farm {
  webapp ':ProjectA'
  webapp ':ProjectB'
}
----

Here we define that default farm includes two projects - ProjectA and ProjectB. As soon as we start farm tasks, both projects will run on the same jetty server with distinct context paths.

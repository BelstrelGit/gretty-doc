jettyStop sends "stop" command to a running jetty server.

== Syntax

[source,bash]
----
gradle jettyStop
----

== Effects

jettyStop does not build source code, it only sends "stop" command to
localhost:link:Gretty-configuration.html#_serviceport[servicePort]. Usually
jettyStop is used to stop Gretty/Jetty process started by jettyStart[War][Debug].

== Instantiation and extension

The object called jettyStop is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes.html#_jettystoptask[JettyStopTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.JettyStopTask

task('MyStop', type: JettyStopTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialStop extends JettyStopTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyStop2', type: VerySpecialStop) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.

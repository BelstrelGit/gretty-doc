== Effects

localhost:link:Gretty-configuration#servicePort[servicePort]. Usually
jettyStop is used to stop Gretty/Jetty process started by jettyStart[War][Debug].

== Instantiation and extension

The object called jettyStop is actually an instance of link:Gretty-task-classes#jettystoptask[JettyStopTask] class, created and configured for you by Gretty. You can instantiate or even extend this class on your own:

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'gretty'

import org.akhikhl.gretty.JettyStopTask

task('MyStop', type: JettyStopTask) {
  // ...
}

class VerySpecialStop extends JettyStopTask {
  // ...
}

task('MyStop2', type: VerySpecialStop) {
  // ...
}
----

If you are going to instantiate or extend this task class yourself, make sure you've learned it's properties and methods.
